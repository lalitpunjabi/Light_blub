# Newton_Light_blub
This interactive web animation showcases a series of stylized light bulbs inspired by Newton's discoveries, designed using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, specifically GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animation effects.

Each light bulb has a dynamic filament and glowing effect that responds to user interactions. The SVGs are precisely designed to resemble light bulbs with details like filaments, glass, and fittings.
